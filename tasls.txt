1. a loader, fix sound files and reduce sound size
2. find a way to fix collision, give less missed good shots
---
use current position and last frame position to calculate collision
so it will avoid some quirky pre rebound
fix y collison so if aball is on a platform it will stay on it rather than falling thru it



3. figure out why 'direct' is so rare
4. detailed background, player sprite overhaul
5. give basket a bigger rebound fraction so it is more easy to score
6. add more trick types, enchance tricks parsing and score calculates
7. fix alley oop velocity, now it is quite weird. also fix alley oop lines, when doing a high shot the lines are hard to see, try to interpolate more points


bugs
1. sometimes the prediction line would disappear, this is pretty bad
